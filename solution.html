Relative Time: An array containing the time points relative to the start of the recording for each data point.
Data: An array containing the velocity measurements at each corresponding time point.
Here's a breakdown of SINN's functionalities:

Data Preprocessing: SINN first preprocesses the data to remove noise and enhance the signal of interest. This involves:

Absolute Value Transformation: Converting the data to absolute values to focus on the magnitude of the velocity changes.
Mean Removal: Subtracting a calculated mean value from the absolute data to center the signal around zero.
Event Detection: SINN employs a threshold-based approach to detect potential seismic events:

Adaptive Threshold: It calculates a dynamic threshold based on the average absolute value of the data.
Sliding Window Analysis: The code iterates through the absolute data using a sliding window.
Event Detection Logic: If the absolute value of a data point exceeds the threshold and a certain percentage of subsequent data points within a specific window also exceed the threshold, an event is identified.
Visualization: SINN generates a visualization with two key components:

Time Series Plot: This plot shows the original velocity data alongside the calculated threshold and vertical lines marking identified events (red) and potential noise segments (green).
Spectrogram: A spectrogram depicts the frequency content of the data over time, providing insights into the dominant frequencies associated with the events.
Benefits of SINN
SINN offers several advantages for automated seismic signal analysis:

Efficiency: It automates the process of identifying potential seismic events, saving time and resources compared to manual analysis.
Standardization: It provides a consistent and objective approach to event detection, minimizing human bias.
Customization: The threshold and window size parameters can be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of the seismic data being analyzed.
Please note:  SINN is currently under development and further refinement is ongoing. We are actively exploring ways to improve its accuracy and efficiency.
