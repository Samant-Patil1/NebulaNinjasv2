<section class="section"><h2>Our Solution: Automated Seismic Signal Processing from Space</h2></section>

<section class="section">
    <p>At NebulaNinjas, we are revolutionizing the field of lunar and planetary seismology with our innovative seismic signal processing solution. Our web-based platform, built on powerful Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, empowers researchers and space agencies to efficiently analyze seismic data collected from space missions.</p>

<section class="section">
    <p>Unveiling Hidden Seismic Activity. Our core technology lies in the SINN class (Seismic Intelligent Noise Neutralizer). <br><br>This class takes two key inputs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Relative Time:</b> An array containing the time points relative to a reference point in the seismic data.</li>
        <li><b>Velocity Data:</b> An array containing the seismic velocity measurements at corresponding time points.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SINN performs the following key steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Noise Reduction:</b> It employs a novel approach to reduce background noise by calculating a dynamic mean based on the absolute value of the data. This technique effectively removes low-level noise, enhancing the detection of seismic events.</li>
        <li><b>Event Detection:</b> SINN utilizes a sliding window approach to identify potential seismic events. It analyzes the absolute value of the data within the window and compares it to the dynamic mean. If the absolute value consistently exceeds a threshold for a specific duration, the system flags it as a potential seismic event.</li>
        <li><b>Visualization:</b> SINN generates informative plots to help researchers visualize and interpret the results. The plots include:</li>
        <ul style="margin-left: 4cm;">
            <li><b>Time Series Plot:</b> This plot displays the original velocity data along with the dynamic mean, highlighting the identified seismic events.</li>
            <li><b>Spectrogram:</b> This visualization depicts the frequency distribution of the seismic energy over time, offering valuable insights into the nature of the seismic activity.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <p>Benefits of Our Solution. <br><br>Our seismic signal processing solution offers several advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Automated Processing:</b> SINN automates the analysis of seismic data, saving researchers valuable time and effort compared to manual processing methods.</li>
        <li><b>Improved Accuracy:</b> The dynamic noise reduction and event detection algorithms enhance the accuracy of identifying seismic events, particularly low-magnitude ones.</li>
        <li><b>Enhanced Visualization:</b> The generated plots provide researchers with a clear and comprehensive view of the seismic data, facilitating in-depth analysis and interpretation.</li>
        <li><b>Web-based Platform:</b> Our user-friendly web platform allows researchers to access and utilize the processing tools from any device with an internet connection, promoting collaboration and wider use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By leveraging the power of Python and our innovative SINN class, we are providing researchers with a cutting-edge solution to unlock valuable insights from seismic data collected during space missions. This has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of lunar and planetary geology,  seismic activity, and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>
