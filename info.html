<section class="section" id="home">
    <p>Seismic signal processing is the application of signal processing techniques to seismic data. Seismic data is collected by seismometers, which are instruments that measure ground motion caused by earthquakes, volcanic activity, or other sources. <br><br>This data can be used for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Earthquake monitoring and prediction:</b> Seismic data can be used to track seismic activity and identify potential earthquake hazards.</li>
        <li><b>Oil and gas exploration:</b> Seismic data can be used to locate underground oil and gas reservoirs.</li>
        <li><b>Volcano monitoring:</b> Seismic data can be used to track volcanic activity and predict eruptions.</li>
        <li><b>Engineering applications:</b> Seismic data can be used to design structures that can withstand earthquakes.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <p>Key Concepts in Seismic Signal Processing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Seismic wave types:</b> There are three main types of seismic waves: P-waves, S-waves, and surface waves. Each type of wave has different characteristics that can be used to identify the source of the earthquake and estimate its magnitude.</li>
        <li><b>Seismic data acquisition:</b> Seismic data is typically collected using arrays of seismometers. The spacing of the seismometers can affect the resolution and accuracy of the data.</li>
        <li><b>Seismic data processing:</b> Seismic data must be processed to remove noise and extract the signal of interest. Common processing techniques include filtering, deconvolution, and migration.</li>
        <li><b>Seismic data interpretation:</b> Once the data has been processed, it can be interpreted to identify the source of the seismic event and estimate its characteristics.</li>
    </ul>
